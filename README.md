# README FILE GENERATOR

## Description

 AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

 ## Installation

* Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.


* Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

 ## Tests
  
  RUN CODE "node index.js" IN COMMAND-LINE.
